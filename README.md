# follow_steem_active_users
Simple PYTHON script to follow the STEEM BLOCKCHAIN active users

This is another extremely simple python script to play with the STEEM BLOCKCHAIN!

It is linked with my previous repository here:
https://github.com/digital-mine/get_steem_active_users
So to properly works you need to run first the previous one and than this one.

This script follows all the ACTIVE users that have been saved by the previous program, it ignores the users you are following already. the loop will stop once all the users saved in the list has been followed!

The script is very simple, and not "elegant" at all, but I wrote it in 20 minutes, so please be patient about this, I'll try to update it, and get it a bit more "elegant" when I'll get some time, for now it does it job with no issue ;)
